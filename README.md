Compression-Aware Intelligence is the framework that treats hallucinations and contradictions not as errors to eliminate, but as measurable signals of representation strain inside any cognitive system, and uses those signals to guide stability, coherence, and self-correction. CAI states that hallucination is a representational conflict problem. Compression strain measures it. CAI is the framework for evaluating it. when two prompts with the same meaning produce different outputs, the model’s latent representations are in conflict and Compression-Aware Intelligence (CAI) measures that conflict as compression strain.
